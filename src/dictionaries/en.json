    "contentText3": "With a ready and tested prototype of the site as the guide, we begin development. We use Next.Js; a cutting edge development framework for designing fast and sleek web-applications. Next.Js incorporates Server-Side Rendering(SSR) and Static Site Generation(SSG), making the site fast and easily discoverable for search engines. The open source Strapi is used for the customized Content Management System. The site will be implemented using Clean Architecture, ensuring ease of maintenance and further development down the line.",
    "contentTitle4": "SUPPORT",
    "contentText4": "The ready site will be subjected to User Acceptance Testing, masking sure the site adheres to the requirements set with the customer during Discovery and Design.

    "contentText2": "Once requirements are clear, the next step is to map out the required features for MVP (minimum viable product), as well as the technologies to be used.

With it, we are able to visualize and test the User Interface with you and all relevant stakeholders; we introduce Usability Testing for more personalized UI-solutions. During this process we will use platform-specific guidelines: Material Design for Android and Human Interface Guidelines for iOS. These guidelines offload developer time and allow the UI and UX that users are accustomed to.",
    "contentTitle4": "IMPLEMENTATION",
    "contentText4": "With a ready and tested prototype of the application as the guide, we begin development. We use Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android, React Native and Flutter for cross-platform.

    "contentText5": "The ready app will be subjected to User Acceptance Testing, making sure the site adheres to the requirements set with the customer during Discovery and Design.

Other avenues of deployment are possible.",
    "contentTitle6": "MAINTENANCE",
    "contentText6": "During post-deployment, we use tools such as Firebase Crashlytics to pinpoint and fix issues with stability. We also use performance tools, like Firebase Performance Analytics, to ensure the app runs smoothly. We can collect additional usage data on how users use the application, to further evaluate how well it fits customer needs and what features are lacking to further develop the application. We are able to collect behavioral data, usage engagement, feedback and technical data."
